# dotfiles
Here lies my dotfiles.

This repository contains my configuration files for:
* st (simple terminal)
* dwm (dynamic window manager)
* vim
* bash
* ncmpcpp
* mpd
* ranger
* and more...

If you want to auto install these on a desktop or ThinkPad E550 system, you can use my post-installation scripts found at https://github.com/rethyxyz/scripts for Arch.
