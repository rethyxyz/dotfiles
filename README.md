# dotfiles
Here lies my dotfiles.

This repository contains configs for:
* urxvt
* st (simple terminal)
* dwm (dynamic window manager)
* i3wm
* vim
* xinit
* bash
* ncmpcpp
* mpd
* openbox
* XFCE
* i3blocks
* ranger
* and more...

If you want to auto install these dotfiles for a desktop or ThinkPad E550/laptop system, you can view my post-installation scripts found at https://github.com/rethyxyz/Scripts

NOTE: I do not maintain any of the i3wm/i3blocks or urxvt configuration files anymore.
