# dotfiles
Here lies my dotfiles.

This repository contains my configuration files for:
* vim
* bash
* ncmpcpp
* mpd
* ranger
* and more...

If you want to auto install these on a desktop or ThinkPad E550 system, you can use my post-installation scripts found at https://github.com/rethyxyz/scripts for Arch. I have two dwm builds and an st build, which can be found at https://github.com/rethyxyz/dwm, https://github.com/rethyxyz/dwm-minimal, and https://github.com/rethyxyz/st.
